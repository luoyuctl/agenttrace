## v0.4.0 - 2026-05-04

### Changed

- Polished the first-run TUI demo path with clearer selected-session context,
  scan-friendly status text, refreshed demo assets, and an updated recording
  script. (#91)
- Improved TUI feedback around loading, empty diff states, and command-mode
  results so users get immediate guidance while navigating. (#122)
- Made `--waste` use the same latest-session selection behavior as `--latest`,
  reuse loaded diagnostics, and show clearer waste-report copy. (#95)

### Fixed

- Stabilized overview report ordering for recent sessions and anomaly tie
  breakers across JSON, Markdown, and HTML outputs. (#104)
- Aligned overview aggregate metrics with TUI discovery, including cache
  read/write tokens in the exported totals. (#114)
- Clamped loop waste so reported waste cannot exceed total session cost. (#116)
- Aligned TUI cache status wording with `agenttrace --doctor`. (#117)
- Isolated auto-discovery tests from runner-specific environment configuration.
  (#120)

### Validation

- Added repeatable CI gates for output contracts, deterministic demo output,
  report semantics, release surfaces, and Pages artifacts. (#118)
- Documented the launch-kit validation gates and release consistency checklist
  for public demo and install surfaces. (#115, #121)
